Partial derivatives are a fundamental concept in calculus, particularly in multivariable calculus, where functions depend on multiple variables.

Here's an explanation of partial derivatives:

Single Variable Derivative:
In single-variable calculus, you find the derivative of a function with respect to a single variable. For example, if you have a function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x), the derivative 
𝑓
′
(
𝑥
)
f 
′
 (x) represents the rate of change of 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) with respect to 
𝑥
x.
Multivariable Functions:
In multivariable calculus, you deal with functions that depend on multiple variables. For example, a function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
f(x,y) might depend on both 
𝑥
x and 
𝑦
y.
In this case, the partial derivative of 
𝑓
f with respect to 
𝑥
x, denoted as 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑥
∂x
∂f
​
 , represents the rate of change of 
𝑓
f with respect to 
𝑥
x, while treating 
𝑦
y as a constant.
Similarly, the partial derivative of 
𝑓
f with respect to 
𝑦
y, denoted as 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑦
∂y
∂f
​
 , represents the rate of change of 
𝑓
f with respect to 
𝑦
y, while treating 
𝑥
x as a constant.
Geometric Interpretation:
Geometrically, the partial derivative 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑥
∂x
∂f
​
  represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of 
𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
f(x,y) at a specific point in the 
𝑥
𝑦
xy-plane, with respect to the 
𝑥
x-axis.
Similarly, 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑦
∂y
∂f
​
  represents the slope of the tangent line with respect to the 
𝑦
y-axis.
Computing Partial Derivatives:
To compute partial derivatives, you differentiate the function with respect to one variable while treating the other variables as constants.
For example, to find 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑥
∂x
∂f
​
 , you differentiate 
𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
f(x,y) with respect to 
𝑥
x while treating 
𝑦
y as a constant, and vice versa for 
∂
𝑓
∂
𝑦
∂y
∂f
