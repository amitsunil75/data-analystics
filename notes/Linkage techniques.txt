Commmanly used linkage techniques are follows.


Single Linkage (or Minimum Linkage): The distance between two clusters is defined as the minimum distance between any single data point in the first cluster and any single data point in the second cluster.

Complete Linkage (or Maximum Linkage): The distance between two clusters is defined as the maximum distance between any single data point in the first cluster and any single data point in the second cluster.

Average Linkage: The distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between all pairs of data points, one from each cluster.

Ward's Linkage: This method minimizes the variance when merging clusters. It calculates the increase in the total within-cluster variance that would result from merging two clusters.
