# Data Analytics Project  

## Overview  
This project focuses on using **Python**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, and **Excel** to analyze datasets, uncover insights, and create interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making. The process includes cleaning and preprocessing data, conducting exploratory analysis, and presenting insights visually.  

---

## Objectives  
- **Data Preparation**: Organize and clean raw data using Python and Excel.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns, trends, and outliers.  
- **Visualization**: Create compelling visuals and dashboards using Tableau and Power BI.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Deliver data-driven recommendations for stakeholders.  

---

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: For data manipulation, statistical analysis, and initial visualizations.  
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI**: For dynamic dashboards and report creation.  
- **Tableau**: For advanced storytelling and data visualization.  
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning, pivot tables, and basic analysis.

## Key Features  
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:  
   - Use **Python** and **Excel** to clean messy datasets and handle missing values.  
   - Transform data into structured formats for analysis.  

2. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in **Python** with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.  
   - Use Excel’s pivot tables for quick trend spotting.  

3. **Dashboard Creation**:  
   - Build dynamic, interactive dashboards in **Power BI** and **Tableau** to visualize key metrics.  
   - Provide real-time and shareable insights for stakeholders.  

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
   - Summarize key findings from the analysis to make actionable recommendations.
